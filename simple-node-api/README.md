# simple-node-api

NodeJS and Express CRUD Project.

To run the project, it is important to install Node v20.15.1 and Express 4.19.2. For local execution without needing to restart the server, you can install Nodemon. Additionally, to make POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests, you can use Postman or the Visual Studio Code extension REST CLIENT. In any case, I will show you examples of how to make requests in the "requests.html" file.
